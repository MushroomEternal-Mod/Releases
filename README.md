# Mushroom Eternal

## Description
Mushroom Eternal d is designed to help players effectively buy and sell items within the Hypixel Skyblock Auction House. This mod automates various aspects of the flipping process, allowing users to maximize their profits and minimize their time spent manually searching for deals. With features like price tracking, automated bidding, and user-friendly settings, this mod enhances the gameplay experience for dedicated players. This mod uses highly complicated algorithms to ensure the best flips are found.

## Features
- **Price Tracking**: Monitor item prices in real-time and receive alerts when auctions are detected with a high profit margin. 
- **Automated Flipping**: Set your maximum and minimum price threshold, and the mod will automatically flip items for you. Has been confirmed to be safe. (toggleable)
- **Auction/Bin Sniper**: The mod will automatically purchase drastically underpriced BINs. These items will not be automatically sold.
- **Anti-Delay**: Customize the level of anti-delay, allowing you to adjust for auction server lag or competition to improve sniping accuracy. (don't set it to zero percent, set it to something like 15). 
- **Unthrottled**: Websites like cofl throttle the amounts of flips and even outright BLOCK snipes, which only the author can see. This means that if the profit margin is high enough, they just wont show up. Furthermore, cofl only shows around 2/5 of all flips currently available. Mushroom Eternal was designed for flippers who want to hit it big, by using this mod, you will access UNTHROTTLED FLIPS.
-  **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple commands and settings menus make it easy for players of all skill levels to utilize the mod effectively.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- **Forge Mod Loader** installed (make sure it's compatible with your Minecraft version).
- Booster cookie, or simply open the auction house 

### Steps to Install
1. **Download the Latest Release**: Go to the [Releases]((https://github.com/Mushroom-Eternal-Flipper/Releases/)) page and download the latest `.jar` file for the mod.
2. **Locate the Mods Folder**: Find your Minecraft installation directory and navigate to the `mods` folder. (Usually accessible by doing %appdata% in the windows search bar, then going to .minecraft, then 'mods').
3. **Place the Mod in the Mods Folder**: Move the downloaded `.jar` file into the `mods` folder.
4. **Launch Minecraft**: Start the Minecraft launcher, select the profile with Forge, and click "Play."

### Verifying Installation
To Verify the mod has been installed correctly, click on the Auction Master. This mod completely overhauls the auction UI, so you definitely should see a difference. You can also run the command /flips settings.


### Starting the Mod
- Open the settings menu using `/flips settings` to customize your experience. Here you can set your desired thresholds for price alerts, automated bids and toggle it on or off. (Uncap the threshold or set it high to be able to snipe expensive items). Dont set it above the value of your purse, obviously.

### Using Price Tracking
1. When the mod is running, it will actively monitor item prices in the Auction House.
2. If an item has a good profit margin, you will receive a notification.
3. You can use this feature without automated buying and selling
4. I suggest only running this mod on your island or somewhere quiet, as it can quickly flood your chat if you allow all flips.

### Automated Flipping
- Set your maximum bid/buy price for items you want to purchase, and the mod will automatically buy and sell items for you when necessary.
- You can modify your bidding strategy in the settings menu to ensure optimal purchasing.

### Sniping
  - Items detected at a far lower price than others will be instantly purchased (you can configure this mod to only detect snipes for certain items).

## Troubleshooting
- **Mod Not Working**: If the mod isn't functioning, ensure you have the correct version of Forge installed and that the mod file is placed in the correct `mods` folder.
- **Game Crashes**: If Minecraft crashes upon launch, try removing the mod from the `mods` folder and running the game again. Check for compatibility issues with other mods.
- **If those fail, try uninstalling Skytils if you have it.**
